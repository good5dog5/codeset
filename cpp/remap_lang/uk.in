Each wireless band may be configured simultaneously or separately.

Select an encryption type:
WEP is an older type of encryption that is compatible with most wireless devices. It is not considered secure and should not be used to protect sensitive data.
TKIP is an encryption method which is somewhat more secure then WEP.
AES is the most secure wireless encryption currently available. It is highly recommended if all your clients support it.
WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK use a password (pre-shared key) to authenticate wireless clients.
