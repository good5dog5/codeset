fetchmail (6.3.6~rc3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Using at least one of the options "sslproto 'tls1'", "sslfingerprint" or
    "sslcertck" enforces STARTTLS for POP3 and IMAP and terminates the connection
    if unsuccessful. The same configuration causes permanent connection failure
    with POP2, which is obsolete and does not support STLS.  fetchmail 6.3.5 and
    older had no way to enforce TLS. With those older versions, TLS was always
    opportunistic, but fetchmail would happily transmit the password in cleartext
    if STARTTLS failed.
    Configurations using --ssl --sslcertck however have been safe.

fetchmail (6.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    File /etc/default/fetchamil has been added to stablish if user wants to
    start fetchmail on boot or not.
    On install time we try to determine from old version if start or not.
    Default will be to not start.
    This addition is necessary since upgrades of the package while the users
    hadn't finish to configure fetchmail properly were breaking the upgrade.
    This had bitten quite a few users.
    The fetchmail-ssl dummy package has been removed since it is no longer
    needed.
  	Due to #327250 fetchmail home directory (/var/run/fetchmail) changed to
    /var/lib/fetchmail
