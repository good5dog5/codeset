fetchmail (6.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Make the APOP challenge parser more distrustful and have it reject
      challenges that do not conform to RFC-822 msg-id format, in the hope to make
      mounting man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) against APOP a bit more difficult
      (CVE-2007-1558).
    - Fix manual page: --sslcheck -> --sslcertck (Closes: #413059).
    - Fix segfault on NULL pointer reference in bsmtp (Closes: #416625).
    - Make BSMTP output actually work (Closes: #416812).

fetchmail (6.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [New upstream version]
  * Repair --user: using SSL certificate/key authentication overrode the
    --user option.  Now the latter takes precedence, and only defaults to the
    certificate's common name (Closes: #400950).
  * DNS: Detect /etc/resolv.conf changes: On systems that have res_search(),
    assume we also have res_init() and call it (suggested by Ulrich Drepper,
    glibc bug #3675) in order to make libc or libresolv reread the resolver
    configuration at the beginning of a poll cycle.  This is important when
    fetchmail is in daemon mode and /etc/resolv.conf is changed later by
    dhcpcd, dhclient, pppd, openvpn or other ip-up/ipchange scripts
    (Closes: #389270, #391698).
  * Important security fixes for: CVE-2006-5867 and CVE-2006-5974.
  [Nico Golde]
  * added NEWS file to the packages (Closes: #406328).

    this bug (Closes: #262257).

fetchmail (6.3.6~rc3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [New upstream version]
  * sslproto keywords are now case insensitive
  * In verbose mode, log every IP fetchmail tries to connect to, to avoid
    misleading the user. Suppress EAFNOSUPPORT errors from socket() call, too.
    (Closes: #361825)
  * Track getaddrinfo() results to properly free them after timeouts and
    make sure that getaddrinfo() isn't interrupted by a timeout.
    (Closes: #294547, #377135).
  * If the lockfile ends before the process ID, treat it as stale and unlink it.
    Reported by Justin Pryzby, (Closes: #376603).
  * SECURITY FIX (CHANGES BEHAVIOR):
    Using at least one of the options "sslproto 'tls1'", "sslfingerprint" or
    "sslcertck" enforces STARTTLS for POP3 and IMAP and terminates the connection
    if unsuccessful. The same configuration causes permanent connection failure
    with POP2, which is obsolete and does not support STLS.  fetchmail 6.3.5 and
    older had no way to enforce TLS. With those older versions, TLS was always
    opportunistic, but fetchmail would happily transmit the password in cleartext
    if STARTTLS failed.  Reported by and fixed in cooperation with Isaac Wilcox.
    Configurations using --ssl --sslcertck however have been safe.

  [Nico Golde]
  * Source-Version is deprecated, using source:Version now,
    thanks Tolimar for the hint.
  * Added colons in init to fit debian-policy
    section 9.4 (Closes: #398160).
  * Changed awaken call to restart cause of DNS problems (Closes: #391698).
  * Added NEWS entry to inform about behaviour changes.
  * Added XS-Vcs-Svn field to control file.

  * Updated debhelper dependency to version (>= 5.0.37.2) because of dh_python
    call.
  [Hector Garcia]

    be able to do binary rebuilds.

    - Patch to avoid a segfault in multidrop/received mode when the
      Received: headers are malformatted.

      the header to 7 bits.

      reported. (Closes: #242384)

      the other process's exit.

         example how to use it. (Closes: #213484)
    - Try to obtain FQDN as our own host by default, rather than using
     "localhost". If hostname cannot be qualified, complain noisily and continue,
      unless Kerberos, ODMR or ETRN are used (these require a FQDN).
      Partial fix of Debian Bug#150137. (Closes: #316454).

      (Closes: #320645).

      around the qmail + Courier-IMAP problem in Debian. (Closes: #338007).
    - Fixes: when trying to send a bounce message, don't bail out if we cannot
      qualify our own hostname, so we aren't losing the bounce. Instead, pass the
      buck on to the SMTP server and use our own unqualified hostname.
      (Closes: #317761)
    - Updated translations: Albanian [sq] (Besnik Bleta), Catalan [ca] (Ernest
      AdroguÃ© Calveras), Czech [cs] (Miloslav Trmac), German [de] (MA),

  * Remove fetchmail-up and fetchmail-down scripts. There is no reason 
    at all not to call /etc/init.d/fetchmail for the ppp up and down 
    functions. (closes: #134190)
  * Add sample /usr/share/doc/fetchmail{-ssl,}/ip-down example script

fetchmail (5.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream source:
    + Document interaction of expunge in POP3 and servers which require a
      delay before reconnection (closes: #132769)
    + vsprintf underflow fixes by Sunil Shetye.
    + Added warning about UIMS POP3 server.
    + Sunil Shetye's patch for idle timeout during poll.
  * Update copyright file (closes: #133497)
  * Re-create /var/run/fetchmail on init.d script (closes: #133577)
  * A recent upload disabled fingerprint output when running in silent
    mode (closes: #126221)
  * Use a safer (but far more likely to leave cruft behind) method of
    removing the fetchmail user during purge.  Users that request fetchmail to
    be purged will not lose anything they left behind in /var/run/fetchmail,
    even if they DID tell dpkg to purge all fetchmail traces from the system.
    Don't expect such level of babysitting very often (closes: #130779)
  * Fix fuckage on new i18n templates, and update da.po while at it
  * fetchmail, fetchmail-ssl: call db_purge on install and upgrades, to 
    let debconf know that all templates were moved to fetchmail-common.
    Otherwise, they are not removed from the system on purge

    returns PS_TRUNCATED (closes: #128672)
  * Fix longstanding SSL hang w/ 100% CPU usage bug, thanks to
    Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de> for tracking down and
    fixing the bug (closes: #127041)

fetchmail (5.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + Expunge edge case fix by Sunil Shetye
    + Fixes for some odd IMAP and SMTP edge cases by Sunil Shetye
    + UIDL bug fix by Matthias Andree

fetchmail (5.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix minor upgrade glitch: now remove /usr/share/doc/fethmail{-ssl,}
    in new fetchmail{-ssl,} preinst script (closes: #126155)
  * Tweak descriptions of fetchmail-common, fetchmail and fetchmail-ssl
    to mention each other (closes: #126345)
  * Fix non-initialization of deletions(imap.c), which resulted in random
    crashes. Thanks to Sunil Shetye <shetye@bombay.retortsoft.com> for
    tracking down the issue and for a preliminary version of the patch.
  * Add umask 022 and some chmod --reference to postinst, so that we create
    /etc/default/fetchmail with mode 644 and avoid changing its permissions
    later.  I will not attempt to chmod 644 it, since the user might have a
    good reason to want it mode 600, so old files will remain 600 until the
    user notices and chmods it himself if he wants to (closes: #126655)
  * Add Danish debconf templates, thanks Claus Hindsgaul
    (closes: #126595, #126596)

fetchmail (5.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Twilight in the North Sea" release
  * New upstream source:
     + OPIE bug fixes by Jun Miyoshi <usako@omnisci.co.jp>.
     + Documented known IDLE bug in the todo.html file.
     + Sunil Shetye's fix for a timeout/reconnect bug.
     + LMTP fix from Toshiro HIKITA <toshi@sodan.org>.
     + The duplicate-killer doesn't try to operate if we can get an actual
        recipient address from the trace headers.
  * Fix usage of dpkg-architecture in debian/rules: do not append -gnu to
    the result, dpkg-architecture might be fixed to actually work as it
    should someday, after all...
  * Create a fetchmail-common package, to fix once and for all the problems
    resulting from the sharing of conffiles between fetchmail and
    fetchmail-ssl (closes: #123056)
  * fetchmail-up: return exit status 0 if $DAEMON is not there to be run
  * ip-up: return exit status 0 if initscript is not there to be run
  * Document well in README.Debian just how dumb it is to forget to test-run
    fetchmail with the 'keep' option when one changes the MTA/MDA
    configuration, or fetchmail's. Also document the less-likely-to-delete-
    messages way: setting antispam to -1 and setting "no bouncemail".
    Upstream does not want to change the antispam defaults, and I happen to
    think this is his call. OTOH, I will add an example config with safe
    options, and if clueless people use that one, they will be [mostly] safe
    from harm (closes: #123759)
  * Report errors while opening logfile (closes: #120526)
  * Change initscript slightly to show 'fetchmail' before trying to start
    or signal it (closes: #121939)
  * lintian override: "E: fetchmail-ssl usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package":
    fetchmail-ssl DOES come from exactly the same source of fetchmail-common,
    due to the ssl transformation hack.  This hack will be shortlived. As soon
    as woody is out or crypto in main arrives, I am killing the non-crypto
    version of fetchmail.

fetchmail (5.9.5-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Braindamaged sudo usage hits again. I am done with this, screw $HOME --
    sudo users make this useless and still expect stuff to work. Now use 
    getent passwd instead of assuming $HOME has anything useful at all in
    these checks (closes: #122716).  Yet another 'tip' for the currently
    in limbo "debian packaging manual/howto/whatever".
  * Apply patches from Mikael Andersson <mikan@debian.org> to fix build
    with Debian kerberos4th. You better be using a new kerberos4th (>= 1.1), 
    or else this will break your build

fetchmail (5.9.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complile all archs using -O instead of -O2, since upstream

fetchmail (5.9.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yet another workaround against #119366, make sure the owner of
    /var/run/fetchmail is fetchmail:nogroup (closes: #120519)
  * Add the chown workaround to the init script too, just in case
  * Added "key fingerprint" and "#### body octets" to logcheck.ignore
    (closes: #120398)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 00:29:04 -0200

fetchmail (5.9.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added fetchmail\[[0-9]+\]: sleeping to logcheck.ignore (closes: #119682)

fetchmail (5.9.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

fetchmail (5.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Very dark skies ahead" release
  * Enjoy NLS while it lasts. Upstream may drop it in the close future,
    and I am not sure I will keep it alive in a Debian fork (I will certainly
    try, however)
  * New upstream source:
    + Finished license cleanup, all licenses in the distribution are now
      officially GPL-compatible.
    + Added a length check to from64tobits() after receiving a warning that
      it might create buffer overflows.  No exploitable overflows were found
      by a careful case-by-case audit, and at minimum an exploit would have
      required that the mailserver be subverted
    + Changed the logging logic along lines suggested by Jan Klaverstijn
    + fetchmailconf looks first in the directory it's running from to find
      fetchmail
    + Make sure we vet a success status correctly from open_smtp_sink()
      and open_bsmtp_sink()
    + Immediately abort if a non-empty QMAILINJECT environment variable is
      found. If it is set and contains f or i, qmail-inject or qmail's
      sendmail `compatibility' wrapper will rewrite From: or Message-ID:
      headers, respectively. En passant, fix the bug that program_name was not
      filled in before used when the user's ID had no PW entry, leading to
      (null) or crash when printing the error message. Patch by Matthias
      Andree
    + Block signals during SockConnect() so we don't get a socket descriptor
      leak if we're hit by an alarm signal during connect(2)
    + Set queryname even when server is inactive; avoids a core-dump bug in
      the fetchids code
  * Add -tt option to strace in the init.d debug-run debug helper
  * Fix all calls to from64tobits so that fetchmail will actually compile,
    I have no idea how it is compiling upstream without this. Maybe my CVS
    tree is weird... oh well, I am using the non-exploitable version, so
    I could care less :P
  * Do not run config.guess anymore, trust output of dpkg-architecture
  * Update fetchmailconf dependency list for the python 2.1 changes

fetchmail (5.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Upstream blues" release(s) :P
  * New upstream source
    + Make -D short option for --smtpaddress active again
    + Make sure IMAP capability checks are caseblind
    + Make sure suffix checks on akalists are properly caseblinded
    + All warning mail now has a generated date stamp
    + End of poll cycle is now logged
    + Sanity check now rejects SSL option if SSL support is not
      compiled in (Closes: #109796)
    + Mike Warfield's fix for using a combined SSL cert and key in a
      single file
    + DNS lookups moved to just before te mailserver socket open, so
      fetchmail now works OK even if started up without Internet
      access. HESIOD lookups moved just before the DNS lookups
    + Make sure the SICHLD handler is called when we run detached
      (this helps with the zombie issue in #95659, I hope)
    + Added FAQ item X8 on why mail sometimes gets an extra )
      appended
    + Thomas Moestl's patch to use querynames in UID files.
    + Timeout to deal with long socket closes (Sunil Shetye).
    + Move from RSA MD5 code to Colin Plumb's public-domain implementation
      (BSD classic license eliminated)
    + Rewrite strcasecmp() (BSD classic license eliminated).
    + Updated Danish po file.
    + Re-enable explicit bounce message on bad address.
  * Make sure .pot files are up-to-date. Will fix this for real in the
    next upstream version, after I know how ESR will fix this upstream,
    and what will come inside the upstream tarball
  * fetchmailconf: fix tuple in sock.connect for python 2.1. Thanks to
    Alain TÃ©sio <alain@onesite.org> for the patch
  * fetchmailconf: disable gross hack from upstream. We do NOT want
    fetchmailconf to look for fetchmail in the current dir before it
    searches $PATH. I shudder at the bug reports from clueless users...
  * Fix problematic changes in 5.9.1-3 that caused POP2 protocol to be
    run without being requested
  * Make sure xgettext knows fetchmail uses GT_() instead of _() for gettext
    (someone in fetchmail-friends pointed the need to do this, but I lost
    his name somehow. Thank you, whomever you are). This actualy exposed
    a bug in gettextize
  * Update documentation on the _() to GT_() transition (sent upstream)
  * Version dependency on debconf due to seen flag
  * Fix typo in debian/copyright. Lintian rules!

fetchmail (5.8.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

    * Always use fetchmail host's FQDN to identify the daemon when sending
      bounce messages.
    * Embarrassing bug of the month -- somehow, `skip' wasn't being
      interpreted!
  * Upstream integrated the security fix added to Debian in 5.8.16-1,
    however I've added a warning should anyone attempt that exploit.

    * Fixed bug in fetchmailconf plugin/plugout code (related to #105987)
    * Handle ! in RFC2821 Return-Path addresses properly

    * Fix for Debian Bug#103822: fetchmailconf fails to write file after

      (closes: #103822)
    * Discard Return-Path headers consisting of a single @
    * Make fetchmailconf dump plugin and plugout options properly
    * Rob Brauns changes for building fetchmail outside its source directory
    * Found (and killed) a subtle SMTP protocol error that was probably
      lurking behind a lot of the bug reports related to bounce mail, thanks
      to Quoc Luu. (Only manifested when the MTA rejected mail due to a bad
      RCPT TO address) -- I think this closes: #88764 (hmh)
  * Disable RSET before QUIT for pop3. This is a temporary measure, and I
    might put it back soon (#104125)
  * Fix serious configure.in bug that broke fallbacks to /usr/sbin/sendmail

    + Don't exit on a failure to DNS-resolve a mailserver name, just
      make it inactive.  Exit only if all lookups fail  (closes: #99197)
    + Restore code to deal with SMTP error responses at RCPT TO time, but
      without issuing an RSET.  This is intended to fix obscure bugs that
      show up in recent Postfix releases and sendmail configurations that
      delay antispam checks on the MAIL FROM line until RCPT TO time
      (maybe fixes #88764)
  * Add better autotools-dev support to debian/rules. Add devscripts to
    build-depends because of this change
  * Close standard input on initscript to make sure fetchmail won't ask

      IF you use plugins and deliver to a MDA, you risk being overrun
      by an army of undead. Don't do it, deliver through SMTP instead

fetchmail (5.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release marks the start of a major code rewrite in fetchmail, so I
    expect things to break. It doesn't help that I had to do a very
    extensive list of changes in the packaging for 5.8.6-3. This is
    unstable, therefore I'm not too concerned. However, you might want to
    stick to 5.8.6-2 and wait for a few days to see if any major bugs show
    up in the BTS before upgrading. You have been warned.
  * New upstream source 
    + Fix fetchmailconf support for tracepolls (closes: #101242)
    + driver.c refactoring in preparation for streaming mode

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 11:26:41 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied patch from Byrial Jensen <byrial@image.dk> to make the
    tracepools RFC-2822 compliant. Also, fixed bogus reference to
    --adaccthdr in fetchmail --help
  * Generate the postinst script in debian/rules from init.defaults and
    *.postinst.template, to avoid poluting /usr/share or sync loss between
    postinst and init.defaults
  * Fix segfault-waiting-to-happen in driver.c. Thanks to Stephan Krings
    <stephan@xmn-berlin.de> for noticing it
  * /etc/default/fetchmail is not a conffile anymore. User-made changes are
    still supported, but any changes made by me will not be propagated
    anymore on upgrades. The "up-to-date" version of the configuration file
    (including defaults and comments) is in the examples directory in the
    documentation (closes: #101025)
  * Disable fetchmailconf support for tracepolls until bug#101242 gets
    fixed upstream

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 02:50:34 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean-up upstream cruft automatically, to make sure it won't choke an
    --with-included-gettext build (not normally used in Debian, but who
    knows...). This is needed because diff cannot delete files
  * Running fetchmail as root is dangerous. The safest way is to run it as a
    very unpriviledged user (you could even chroot it, I suppose) and
    deliver over smtp. Stress this on the documentation
  * Fix initscript so that it will work with POSIXLY_CORRECT set, thanks
    "Sven M. Hallberg" <pesco@gmx.de>
  * Do not abort postinst/prerm if the initscript fails (closes: #100832)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Jun 2001 11:12:53 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    - Reject candidate headers for the MAIL FROM address that have \n in
      them
    - Add capability to insert poll trace data in the Received line
    - Brendan Kehoe's patch to avoid doing DNS lookups on skip entries
      (helps with #99197, but doesn't fix the whole issue)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jun 2001 13:28:19 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Security fix: buffer overflow when rewriting headers longer than 512
    bytes (closes : #100394)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jun 2001 02:34:50 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + Interface option fix from Alexander Kourakov.
    + Attempted fix for Harry McGavran's problems with the Kerberos V build.
    + Added fetchmailnochda.pl to the contrib directory.
    + Sunil Shetye's patches for the seen count on IMAP and auto protocol.
  * Fixed typo in logcheck.ignore (closes: #99706)
  * Removed top_srcdir="." directive in debian/rules, as it broke the build
    with new gettext and autoconf
  * At least two known (and bad) bugs waiting for upstream fix. See 
    TODO.Debian in the source package -- they're not new bugs, AFAIK.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Jun 2001 12:49:23 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + New README.SSL file. If you use SSL, read it; tied to:
    + New SSL certificate options from Thomas Moestl <tmoestl@gmx.net>
    + Frantisek Brabec's patch for better UIDL error recovery
    + Jorg de Jong's patch attempts to handle spaces in the ID part of UIDLs
      (this probably closes: #96489)
  * Fixed small typo in manpage
  * Very minor fixes to work with autoconf 2.50

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 22:42:13 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Zombie-Child Reaper" release
  * Split changelogs (including upstream's), to remove old cruft.
    No information was lost, the complete changelogs are available
    in the source package
  * Serious attempt to allow all dead children to go peacefully to
    the Big Bitbucket In The Sky. Signal handling was really screwed
    up in Linux glibc 2.2 systems (and maybe others) (closes: #95659)
  * fetchmailconf would generate bogus output if the monitor or
    netsec options where enabled (closes: #98127)
  * Use autotools-dev to make sure we need not worry about 
    config.{sub,guess} again.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2001 11:42:13 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "major pain in the neck" release
  * New upstream release
    - Don't cough and die from failure to resolve a skipped host
      (closes: #92530, #92554)
    - SIGCHLD handler now sets SA_RESTART explicitly in order to avoid
      zombies from interrupted system calls (closes: #95993)
    - Do aka suffix match even if DNS checking is enabled
    - Prevent POP3 code from authenticating multiple times on success
    - Fixed IMAP password shrouding
    - Ignore Sender and Resent-Sender headers unless they contain @
    + The `localhost' special case of `via' is gone. Use `plugin %h' for
      talking to ssh instead. THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE IN
      .fetchmailrc SEMANTICS. If you are using this for ssh tunnelling,
      you may need to switch to using a plugin option with %h
      SEE THE FAQ and fetchmail(1) manpage.
  * Also set SA_NOCLDSTOP on SIGCHLD handler, we'll timeout the child
  * Update German template, thanks blade@debian.org (closes: #97155)
  * Add Galician template, thanks Jacobo Tarrio <jtarrio@trasno.net>
  * Fixed build-dependency: libssl096-dev -> libssl-dev
  * Honour /etc/default/fetchmail's CONFFILE in debconf warning tests
  * Trust base-files to manage /var/mail, update policy compliance to 
    3.5.4 and add the proper depends on base-files >= 2.2.0. This
    reduces the mess on many of the scripts, which is a Good Thing.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 13 May 2001 14:35:58 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I should not have got out of bed yesterday" release
  * Fix broken handling of debconf defaults in fetchmail.config
    (closes: #96648)
  * Fix handling of /etc/default/fetchmail for $SERVICE when first
    adding SERVICE to the config file
  * Fix annoying postinst bogosity when creating the fetchmail user
  * Add user-is-really-there test to initscript to close a bogon source

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 May 2001 16:53:08 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I told you, didn't I?" release
  * Warn users that ssh needs to be able to read the RSA/DSA keys to work,
    and that means they must run the system-wide fetchmail as root.
  * Debconf "no system-wide fetchmail" master switch added. Use
    dpkg-reconfigure to re-enable it, or cry silently at the resulting
    breakage if you don't know what you're doing.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sat,  5 May 2001 23:58:05 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "A Debian developer's way is fraught with peril" release
  * New Dutch template, thanks Thomas J. Zeeman (closes: #95737)
  * Add debconf and initscript support to run the system-wide fetchmail
    daemon as user fetchmail.  It is safer, but it won't work if
    fetchmail is told to deliver to a MDA.  Unfortunately, now the
    initscript violates the KISS principle quite throughoutly.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sat,  5 May 2001 01:57:50 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small fixes to Makefile.in to finally have proper builds with all
    possible gettext profiles (none, included, system's).
  * New german template translations, thanks Sebastian Feltel (closes: #94529)
  * Fix typo in templates.br (pt-br -> pt_BR)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Apr 2001 15:32:15 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix upload screwup. No changes
  * Use MULTIDROP(foo) in #92544 fix patch

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Apr 2001 00:41:09 -0300

fetchmail (5.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "it's time for the spring cleanup" release
  * New upstream source
    - Nalin Dahyabai's password parsing and authentication fixes.
    - Golden brand (5.8.0)
  * New upstream gettext 0.10.36 used instead of fetchmail upstream's.  From
    now on, Debian builds will always include the newest Debian packaged
    version of gettext in the package source, just in case (we do not use
    it, though)
  * Build tweaks: to make sure new gettext will work, debian/rules clean now
    adds execute permissions to all files that should have them, instead of
    trusting the upstream tarball
  * Switch to debhelper DH_COMPAT mode 3
  * Kerberos build support in fetchmail is NOT sane. I don't have a very
    good way to test this stuff (and I don't think upstream can, either...),
    but I'll try to at least clean it up to the point of it building
    out-of-the-box using the multiple kerberos packages available in Debian.
    This probably closes: #92793.
    - configure changes to properly detect and work with heimdal-dev,
      kerberos4kth-dev and krb5-dev. Do notice heimdal-dev does not provide
      kerberosIV compatibility in Debian, you need kerberos4kth-dev too if
      you need it (configure.in). Also, Heimdal builds *require* OpenSSL
      support (due to Debian's packaging of Heimdal).
    - rfc1731 seems to require kerberosIV support as far as I can tell from
      RFCs, and the imap.c code agrees with this. This means that now KPOP
      is only available if kerberosIV is as well. Do remember that GSSAPI
      does not require kerberosIV and will work in kerberosV-only setups
      (pop3.c)
  * Fix typo in logcheck.ignore file (closes: #93215)
  * Initscript fixed to not lie about fetchmail already running when it
    fails to start (e.g. due to bad DNS) (closes: #93316)
  * Do not use the poll name when using "via localhost" unless it is
    a multidrop poll. (partialy addresses #92554)

fetchmail (5.7.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix postrm purge target (closes: #92361)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Apr 2001 01:43:41 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source (but not really)
    - No changes from 5.7.6-3 in Debian
  * Build tweaks: now debian/rules makes sure the autotools are never run
    so they have been dropped from build-depends.
  * "--user root" was lost somehow from the initscript, probably in
    one of those late-night hack-the-initscript sessions. Add it
    back (closes: #92124)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Mar 2001 00:45:57 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "GNU autotools are a pain in the arse" release
  * I'm now using a full CVS-style autogen.sh approach. This will
    make fetchmail far more friendly to newly debian-supported archs,
    such as ia64 and hppa which need up-to-date config.guess or config.sub
    support. I just hope nothing got broken in the process...
  * Added menu entry for fetchmailconf

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Mar 2001 01:36:40 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix broken support for build without autoconf/autoheader
  * Added CVS version info to many debian/ files
  * Remind user that /etc/fetchmailrc is not removed on package
    purge (we don't provide it, after all...)
  * Fix bug in sink.c that would cause some SMTP errors not to be
    correctly echoed to the log (e.g. 452 Out of storage)
    (closes: #90966)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Mar 2001 11:28:48 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    - IMAP: don't just quit if GSSAPI or Kerberos IV fail, but 
      try other methods
    - Document the fact the IDLE and multiple folders don't play 
      well together (closes: #89908)
  * Use -pipe for gcc in debian/rules
  * Remove a lot of useless or dangerous cruft from contrib/

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Mar 2001 21:22:27 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix POP2 build breackage
  * Fix POP3 password leakage in fetchmail -v (closes: #90176)
  * Try to compensate for broken sudo setups not correctly
    setting ${HOME} for root, without actually breaking it for
    people that have root's homedir elsewhere than /root
    (closes: #90180)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Mar 2001 23:40:58 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

    ipv6 builds

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2001 19:30:23 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends only in mail-transport-agent, as autobuilders do not
    use the OR dependency.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Mar 2001 14:57:55 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed build-depends (for fallback MDA)
  * Suggests: mail-transport-agent

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 21:57:18 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    - fetchmail now has a fallback MDA strategy for when it cannot connect
      to the SMTP sink. Since not everyone will want to install and configure
      procmail just because of fetchmail, we use /usr/sbin/sendmail as the
      fallback strategy (works with exim, sendmail and postfix. Other MTAs 
      not tested)
  * Patched to allow user to choose fallback strategy
  * New conffile for initscript, /etc/default/fetchmail.  This allows for
    a default --daemon and --syslog behaviour, but will get in the way of
    the clueful people who did the right thing and used set daemon and
    set syslog in /etc/fetchmailrc (closes: #89343)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2001 20:26:56 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for systems where aclocal and autoconf are not available 
    (which actually mean autoconf and automake can be removed from the 
    build-depends, but I'd rather have them installed when building 
    fetchmail)
  * Better changelog for fetchmail-ssl
  * Fix unsafe tempfile handling in fetchmailconf (closes: #89238)
    Thanks go to Colin Phipps for the patch

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2001 13:02:15 -0300

fetchmail (5.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
  * Fixed SA_LEN for glibc 2.2.2 and IPv6
  * Rebuilt NLS support (configure, makefiles) from scratch. Many thanks to 
    NicolÃ¡s Lichtmaier, who helped me a lot to figure out what was broken, 
    and why
  * Warn user to move /root/.fetchids to new location (closes: #88658)

fetchmail (5.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Seamless *build-time* support for kerberos IV and V, as well as for many
    optional configure targets for fetchmail. This allows easy building of custom 
    fetchmail packages, supporting, e.g. POP2 or GSSAPI. See README.Debian and 
    debian/rules files for more information. (closes: #33317)

fetchmail (5.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    Upstream has changed the syntax of "preauth" back to "auth",
    please update your fetchmail configuration files.
  * Maintainer scripts are now able to handle the sharing of
    /etc/init.d/fetchmail by fetchmail and fetchmail-ssl without
    causing problems during purge
  * Avoid causing health problems during system boot ;-) (closes: #86885)
  * "Improved" fetchmail-up and fetchmail-down scripts (closes: #86924)
    This *will* bite your arse if you use PPP and don't read README.Debian;
    Given the debconf annoyance I've added, and this changelog entry, consider
    yourself warned and go read the README.Debian.
  * Debconf support added to warn people about the init.d and ppp
    scripts changes.
  * Added missing Suggests: fetchmailconf to fetchmail-ssl

  * New upstream source:
    - Fixes pop3 AUTH/CAPA stuff so as to be rfc-compliant
  * Please note 5.6.5 made changes to the fetchmailrc format, related
    to the fact that many authorization features (such as CRAM-MD5) are now 
    auto-detected for both IMAP and POP3
  * Reverted change done to driver.c in 5.6.6 which caused fetchmail to emit
    wrong status messages on timeouts when opening the mail server (source)

fetchmail (5.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
  * New maintainer.  Paul orphaned the package, and the other person who
    should become the new fetchmail maintainer went MIA without so 
    much as uploading a new package or finishing his NM application
  * Minor package cleanups
